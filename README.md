## What?

<img alt="Usage example" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amannn/atom-format-javascript-comment/master/usage.gif" />

## Features
 - Single line comments (`// Whatever`)
 - Multiline comments (`* Whatever`)
 - JSDoc tags always start on a new line (` * @param {string} name Some description.`)
 - If no selection is made, the selection is automatically created by examining the lines surrounding the cursor.
 - If some selection is made, only the lines that are within the selection will be processed. However, lines can be selected partially.
 - Completely empty comment lines will be preserved.
 - Processing of multiple comments at once using multiple cursors.

## How?
1. Install format-javascript-comment (either through the package manager or through `apm install format-javascript-comment`).
2. (Partially) select the lines the comment encompasses.
3. Open command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and (partially) type "format comment".
4. Press enter.

## TODO
 - Configurable line length
 - Ignore non-comment lines
