# Format JavaScript comment for Atom

> Reformats your multiline comments into beautiful, maximum 80 character long lines with [minimum raggedness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_wrap_and_word_wrap#Minimum_raggedness). âœ¨

## What?
Turns this:
```js
/**
 * If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break. When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay.
 * @param {number} itKeepsOnRaining
 * @param {string} [targetCity = 'Chicago'] It's got what it takes to make a mountain man leave his home.
 * Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.
 * @return {string}
 */
function whatToDo(itKeepsOnRaining, targetCity = 'Chicago') {
  if (itKeepsOnRaining) return `Levee's goin to break; Going to ${targetCity}`;
  else return 'Sit on the levee and moan';
}
```

Into this:
```js
/**
 * If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break.
 * When the levee breaks I'll have no place to stay.
 * @param {number} itKeepsOnRaining
 * @param {string} [targetCity = 'Chicago'] It's got what it takes to
 * make a mountain man leave his home. Oh, well, oh, well, oh, well.
 * @return {string}
 */
function whatToDo(itKeepsOnRaining, targetCity = 'Chicago') {
  if (itKeepsOnRaining) return `Levee's goin to break; Going to ${targetCity}`;
  else return 'Sit on the levee and moan';
}
```

## Why?
It's easy to format your comments correctly while writing them. But if you edit them later, it's annoying to reformat them.

## Features
 - Single line comments (`// Whatever`)
 - Multiline comments (`* Whatever`)
 - JSDoc tags always start on a new line (` * @param {string} name Some description.`)
 - If no selection is made, the selection is automatically created by examining the surrounding lines.
 - If some selection is made, only the lines that are within the selection will be processed. However, lines can be selected partially.

## How?
1. Install format-javascript-comment (either through the package manager or through `apm install format-javascript-comment`).
2. (Partially) select the lines the comment encompasses.
3. Open command palette (Cmd+Shift+P) and (partially) type "format comment".
4. Press enter.

## TODO
 - Configurable line length
 - Retain blank lines
 - Ignore JSDoc first and last line
 - Ignore non-comment lines
 - Create a selection range across all modified lines at the end
 - Support multiple cursors
